<!-- badges: end -->

OOMPHstat is a online statistical distribution visualizer, built for
PHW142 (Intro to Probability and Statistics in Public Health).

The original version of OOMPHstat was created by [Xander
Posner](mailto:xander@berkeley.edu?subject=OOMPHstat). It was updated in
Spring 2021 to use Bootstrap themes (via argonDash) and further
implemented R Shiny reactivity by [Gene
Ho](mailto:hogenegin@berkeley.edu?subject=OOMPHstat).

Further README to come.
